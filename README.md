# PsychoPass
PsychoPass is a new password manager based off my previous project “Advanced Password Manager GUI”. That project was lack luster and had many flaw. PsychoPass is APMG Reimagined and built from the ground up. Using cryptography, all passwords are saved locally and encrypted using a unique generated encryption key.
